# Gesture-Controlled-Driving
Built a real-time driving control system using hand gestures instead of a keyboard. Utilized MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for gesture detection. Simulated key presses with pynput to control movements like accelerate, steer left/right, and brake in a racing game.
